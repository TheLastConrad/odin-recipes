    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Imagine if you will: peanut butter and jam sandwiched together between two slices of bread. Some would say the description is essentially also the instructions. However, let's put that to the test. WARNING: May contain nuts. Please consult your physician to discuss if PBJ is right for you.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>peanut butter</li>
        <li>jam and/or jelly</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the slices of bread flat on an available and hygenically clean plate.</li>
        <li>Using a butter knife, spoon or any other appropriate utensil for the task, scoop into the peanut butter jar until any amount of the peanut butter is on it.</li>
        <li>Spread the peanut butter onto one of the available slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Repeat the last two steps until the single side of that piece of bread has been covered with an even coating of peanut butter.</li>
        <p><em>At this point, we strongly urge you to clean off the utensil before proceeding, as cross contamination of food items has been banned by the Geneva Convention. It is our legal obligation to report violaters to the appropriate authorities.</em></p>
        <li>Using the acquired jelly and/or jam, repeat steps 2-4 on the other piece of bread.</li> 
        <li>Place the peanutbutter slice of bread and the jelly slice of bread on top of each other in such a way that the peanutbutter and jelly meet in the middle.</li>
        <p><strong>The sandwich has been assembled and is now ready for consumption. Administer to self as you see fit or to a consenting human participant as needed before food expiration.</strong></p>
      </ol>
