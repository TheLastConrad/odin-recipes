    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Is everything going your way? Do you feel like nothing can go wrong? Have you ever wondered if you needed motivation to safeguard yourself from crushing annihilation? Buddy, sounds like your stomache is rumbling for some good ol' fashion disappointment. A common and debatably popular dish in all cultures, there are lots of variations. Below, we cover the basics to all of them</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>anything you like</li>
        <li>your brain</li>
        <li>jam and/or jelly</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place anything you like or anticipate on bringing happiness in your life on an available and hygenically clean plate. The plate can be metaphorical or literal.</li>
        <li>Whatever great thoughts you have, crank up the optimism. Imagine it solving problems, feeling good, etc.</li>
        <li>Utilize or experience the product.</li>
        <li>While using it, imagine all the properties of it. Are these the best that can actually be experienced? Do you normally feel this level of excitement and elation with a property of this type?</li>
        <p><em>example: Watch any Marvel movie in the last 2 years. Is that anything like the excitement you felt in Avengers: End Game. Heck, is it even anything like what felt in that Monaco racetrack scene in Iron Man 2?</em></p>
        <li>Using acquired jelly and/or jam, repeat steps 2-4 on your hopes and dreams that whatever your liked will ever be that great again.</li> 

        <p><strong>The disappointment has been assembled and is now ready for incorporation. Administer to self as you see fit or to a consenting human participant as needed before feelings in general expire.</strong></p>
      </ol>
