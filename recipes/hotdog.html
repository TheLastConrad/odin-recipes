    <h2>Hotdog™ Sandwich</h2>
    <img src="../images/hotdog.webp" alt="Note: results may vary">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Imagine if you will: a canine who is hot. Congrats! You have commited a thought crime! Zoophilia is not allowed. Please clean your body for Our People's Republic State Sponsered Social Credit Criminal Euthanasia and Organ Recycling Wagon. You may or may not have time to prepare and consume a Hotdog™ flavored sandwich</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>2 slices of bread</li>
        <li>1 jar of Hotdog™ flavoring salve</li>
        <li>jam and/or jelly</li>
      </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Place the slices of bread flat on an available and hygenically clean plate.</li>
        <li>Using a butter knife, spoon or any other appropriate utensil for the task, scoop into the Hotdog™ flavoring jar until any amount of the Hotdog™ flavoring is on it.</li>
        <li>Spread the Hotdog™ flavoring onto one of the available slices of bread.</li>
        <li>Repeat the last two steps until the single side of that piece of bread has been covered with an even coating of Hotdog™ flavoring.</li>
        <p><em>At this point, we strongly urge you to clean off the utensil before proceeding, as cross contamination of food items has been banned by the Geneva Convention. It is our legal obligation to report violaters to the appropriate authorities.</em></p>
        <li>Using the acquired jelly and/or jam, repeat steps 2-4 on the other piece of bread.</li> 
        <li>Place the Hotdog™ flavoring slice of bread and the jelly slice of bread on top of each other in such a way that the Hotdog™ flavoring and jelly meet in the middle.</li>
        <p><strong>The sandwich has been assembled and is now ready for consumption. Administer to self as you see fit or to a consenting human participant as needed before food and/or self expiration.</strong></p>
      </ol>
